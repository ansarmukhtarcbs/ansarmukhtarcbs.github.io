## marketing video on Bolt E-scooter

## Context

The world has seen rapid evolution in technology, especially since the 21st century. The nature of problems has since changed and the scientific advancements have made it possible to solve everyday problems that were once considered trivial. One such problem is related to the “daily commute” that almost everyone in the working class faces. Light methods of traveling short distances have been rapidly evolving and the last decade has seen new methods such as E-Scooters that are much more reliable and convenient. 
The video is basically an encapsulation of the modern-day problems related to the already existing method of short commutes. Problems that are encountered commonly in bicycles such as flat tires and high effort for travel in cases of disease or sickness are addressed in the video and the e-scooter is presented as a viable solution to them.  
The video also goes on to show the features of the product and its specifications to highlight to the customers, if it can be a viable product for them. 
##Target Audience and Interest Capture
The video is targeted toward the audience that is in their mid-20 and it addresses the problems which are commonly faced by the people. Every person who belongs to the working class and travels by bicycle has at least faced one of the problems that were described in the video. 
Secondly, the video showcases an innovative solution to these problems and the concept of an e-scooter is certainly intriguing. The use case is simple enough that the audience realizes the fact that the product doesn’t require much setup and is very convenient even for beginners. 
Thirdly, anything that reduces human effort will be perceived as interesting and a large portion of people wants to make their life easier. Bi-cycle is healthier, but it does require much more effort. The other mode of transportation is buses or cars which are certainly not feasible for everyone. This is where the e-scooter comes in. It provides a middle ground for people to choose their mode of transport. 

## Considerations

The video required many factors to be considered most of which are as follows> 
1-	Special considerations were put into the problem-statement I.e., trying to get the audience to realize the ‘why e-scooter’. The video contains segments in the beginning for this purpose as it is important to enlist the problems earlier. Some of these problems are actually realized by taking feedback from people who are conventional bi-cycles users. These problems are usually related to the manual nature of the bicycle as a mode of transport such as people getting tired after long distances or such as a sick person who is unable to cycle. 
2-	Once the problem has been established, a video segment is dedicated to the ‘setting-up’ of the product i.e e-scooter to show how it addresses those problems. 
3-	A small section is also dedicated to the comparison with other market players. For this, no direct comparison has been drawn but a product specification has been highlighted in detail. Some of the specifications are also demonstrated in a verbal fashion such as the “Range” and the “Battery timing” to grab the attention of the audience.  These are the parameters that generally a customer asks for before making a decision. 
4-	A complete and comprehensive start-to-finish guide for the use case is also demonstrated. 

## Story Telling

The video is basically focused on a problem and portrays special attention to make the audience realize a need. It then goes on to show a brief overview of the solution and how it can overcome those problems. Then it moves in a direction toward product specifications and features. It tries to build up the confidence of the audience towards the safety standards and road regulations as expected from a new product such as an e-scooter. Finally, a segment is dedicated to explaining the ‘ease of use’ of the product in a short and comprehensive manner. 

## Production and timeline

1-	Survey and feedback 
At the start took a survey about the problems which people a facing in their daily life. And got the feedback that in daily routine people are facing the problems to commute the short distance covered with the traditional methods. 
2-	Research existing products and their advertisements. 
In the research process, I found that E-scooter is the best problem solution for this situation so I choose “Bolt E-scooter”. And their targeted customers.
3-	Problem highlights. 
The traditional methods have a problem such as the tire of own bi-cycle on time is not able to ride or sometimes we missed the train by few seconds etc.
5-	Cast selection.
For the casting of this video, I contacted my friends and have a team of five people who perform in this video on different stages and points.
4-	Filming (Locations props etc.)
We choose Deutz-kalker street. And one train station for shooting this video. 
5-	Video editing.
I use the clip champ software which gives me the solution to manage different videos and photos together and also to produce the background voice then allows me to enter the voiceover for my advertisement. The timeline is here



## Reflection and experience

1-	Overall, the whole project has been great learning. It offered an opportunity to learn versatile topics with which I had no experience such as scripting and video editing. 
2-	 I initially underestimated the time for the project and in the end days the workload felt relatively higher. The editing of the video was a completely new domain and I had to learn tools such as clip champ. This was out of my expectations in the beginning. 
3-	The project motivated me to learn new tools which I couldn’t become familiar with otherwise. 
4-	The language that is generally used in the advertisement is all around us but I had previously taken no notice of the way the advertisements communicate. Once the scripting has to be done, I had to look at several advertisements and notice how to market the product digitally. 
5-	In a nutshell, it has been a great opportunity to learn and a fun way to execute the project.
